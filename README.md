This is the begining of switching a ZoneStar Z8R2 from a ZRIB V5.5 board to the SKR-Pro 1.1

So far nothing is tested on the physical machine since i havent had a chance to install the board into it yet.


i'll update (probably badly) as i go

Update:
I didnt update. its now no longer an R2 since ive taken out the second Extruder and its running on an SKR 1.3 

Updated to Marlin 2.0.9.1
